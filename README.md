# FileOrganizer
The FileOrganizer simply helps users manage, their files.
Although, the application isn't in its final design.
It is still greatly useable with some flaws. Which are pretty obvious to the naked eye.
For one you cannot determine your own Folders, you have assigned ones you must create.
You cannot add more directory types and your Input Directory doesn't save.

All things i will fix in the future. :D
